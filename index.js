  # geojs

  Geospatial types and functions for JS.  This is the new revised 1.x branch
  of the GeoJS library which will provide a browserify friendly set types
  and functions designed for working with spatial data.

  A lot has happened since I decoupled some of the spatial logic within
  Tile5 into the original geojs library, and I'm incorporating a lot of
  what I've learnt along the way into this rebuilt from scratch version
  of the libary.
